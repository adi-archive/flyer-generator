ABOUT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a web-interface for creating flyers quickly and easily. 

Use story #1:
 - Person is doing workshop, wants flyer
 - selects event from calendar
 - tweaks the tagline
 - hits the big red button
 - downloads awesome pdf

Use story #2:
 - wants to make an event not on the calendar
 - fill out details
 - hit the big red button
 - download pdf

TODO
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - learn to use cherrypy
 - either refit lolhawk interface, or make a new one
   - DETAILS HERE
 - convert2pdf! (easyyy)
 - learn how to use the google calendar API
   - it's what we're using for the club
 - actually code it up

 - Future:
   - track users/content
     - show who made what at what time within org
     - allow downloading old designed flyers (if lost)
     - keep track of who's flyering where?
     - allow drafts
   - easily add new styles
   - open up the interface to multiple clubs

IDEAS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

basic idea: 
      user ←→ web framework ←→ google / 2pdf

frameworks:
 - web.py
   - no documentation
   - simple/lightweight
 - cherrypy?
   - simple/lightweight
   - is an HTTP framework (not like PHP, has to run outside)
   - not heavily trafficed, not such a big deal
   - moses hackamura is the documentation
   - can run it on a fucking phone
 - rails
   - heavy
 - django
   - heavy

cherrypy doesn't come with a templating or db engine
 - jinja2/sqlalchemy?

conversion:
 - html2pdf
   - how quirky is the html renderer?
 - html2ps | ps2pdf [?]
 - wkhtml2pdf
   - http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
 - xhtml2pdf
   - quirky?
 - imagemagick (svg)
   - not so great, because output is raster
   - ~5MB outputs for fairly complex sheets at a fair resolutions
 - inkscape (svg2pdf)
   - doesn't come standard on server boxes
   - we'll have to run it on the ADI server, which isn't a bad thing
 - batik (svg)
   - java
   - looks like it just rasterizes?
   - have to test
 - pysvg
   - not much documentation
   - author is obviously not cool (zip?? doc??)
 - svglib (python)
   - comes with an svg2pdf
 - svg2pdf (cairo)
   - seems old, unmaintained
   - http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~cworth/svg2pdf/

TESTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Batik
   - Use rasterizer -m "application/pdf" file
   - does generates vector!
 - Inkscape
   - inkscape --export-pdf=out_file in_file
   - inkscape -A out_file in_file
 - svg2pdf (python)
   - does not have an ubuntu package, used easy_install
   - svg2pdf -o svg2pdf-simple-test.pdf simple-test.svg
   - mangled output, though
 - xhtml2pdf
   - No images
   - CSS not perfect
 - html2ps, ps2pdf
   - oh my god it's horrific
 - wkhtml2pdf
   - works like a charm
   - static, might not need dependencies

STUFF DECIDED ON 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

wkhtml2pdf - everyone knows html
 - easy to work with (by many people)
 - debuggable - can take apart and look at what went wrong
 - supported
cherrypy!
