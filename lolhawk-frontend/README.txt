Flyer Generator rev.002

Hi all, have some documentation!

--------------------------------------------
Usage
--------------------------------------------

1. Pop open genFlyer.html, fill out the fields.

2. When you're done, close the dialog, and print preview.

3. It should look like a passable flyer. Make sure your browser doesn't add more cruft like the URL or anything. 
(to get rid of it, check out http://lifehacker.com/5603815/how-can-i-get-rid-of-the-url-and-other-text-when-i-print-from-web-pages)

4. ???

5. PRINT IT!!!!!


Notes:

As of rev.002, the doc is probably filled with broken shit because all I had to dev with is IE8. 

If you close the main dialog, you can get it back by double-clicking on the page.

You are most likely going to have to screw around with your printing margins. I took off an inch from the width and height for a 8.5x11in piece of paper in the design.

--------------------------------------------
Styling
--------------------------------------------

Change the styling by clicking the button.

ATM, only changing the font works.

You can use any font you want, as long as google provides it with their font service and I decided it should go in the list.

There is no github yet, only because I have no computer that I can run git on. I'll have one by December 4th, though.
